    "Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions. However, Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn: Flask is a very easy framework to learn, even for beginners. The documentation is clear and concise, and there are many resources available online to help you get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible: Flask is a very flexible framework, which means that you can use it to build a wide variety of web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensible: Flask is highly extensible, which means that you can add new features and functionality to your applications easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular: Flask is a very popular framework, which means that there is a large community of users and developers who can provide support and help.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fast: Flask is a very fast framework, which makes it ideal for building high-performance web applications."

    "App routing in Flask is the process of mapping URLs to functions. This allows you to create different pages in your web application that can be accessed by different URLs.
